# Blindfold Installer

A small Rust installer for end users (ported from the SayTheSpire2 installer).
GUI by default (wxWidgets via wxdragon — native, screen-reader-accessible
widgets); pass `--cli` for a console flow.

What it does:

1. Finds the Balatro install (Steam library folders/stock paths) and validates it by `Balatro.exe` (Windows) or `Balatro.app` (macOS).
2. Downloads a chosen release of `Blindfold.zip` from GitHub (or installs from
   a local zip, or — "Install dev build" — the latest commit on main via the
   branch zipball, remapping `src/**` and target injector files to
   the same destinations) and extracts it, routed:
   * **Windows**:
     * `version.dll` → the game folder (Lovely Injector; written when missing,
       silently skipped when identical — so updates stay elevation-free. When
       it DIFFERS, the user is asked: an outdated Lovely crashes at launch on
       Blindfold's `lovely.toml`, but a newer one may be serving other mods,
       so neither direction is replaced silently)
     * `Blindfold/**` (excluding `lib/libprism.dylib`) → `%APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods`
       (replaced wholesale, so updates never leave stale files; settings live
       outside and survive)
   * **macOS**:
     * `liblovely.dylib`, `run_lovely_macos.sh` and `steam_lovely_macos.sh` →
       the game folder, with the same missing / identical / differing handling
       as `version.dll` above. The `.sh` files are made executable, since zip
       entries carry no unix mode and Steam cannot exec a launch wrapper
       without it.
     * `Blindfold/**` (excluding `lib/prism.dll`) → `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods`
       (replaced wholesale, as above)
3. Tracks the installed version in `Mods\Blindfold\version` and offers
   Update when GitHub has a newer tag (semver compare). Dev builds are
   recorded as `main@<sha>` and update-check against the tip of main
   instead — "Update dev build" appears whenever main has moved, so dev
   users can stay on that channel; the Install button ("Install release")
   remains the way back to stable.
4. Uninstall removes the mod folder and optionally the injector files (left alone
   if other Lovely mods are present) and the user files
   (`blindfold_settings.lua`, `blindfold_keybinds.lua`, `blindfold.log`).

If `Mods\Blindfold` is a junction — a developer install made by
`scripts\deploy.ps1` — Install is disabled (updates come from `git pull`),
but Uninstall still works: it removes just the link, never the checkout
behind it, after which a release can be installed normally.

Build: `cargo build --release` (or `scripts\build_release.ps1` at the repo
root, which also assembles `Blindfold.zip`). Tests: `cargo test`.
