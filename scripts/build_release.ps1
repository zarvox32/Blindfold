# build_release.ps1 — assemble the release artifacts for a Blindfold release.
#
# Usage: scripts\build_release.ps1 -Version v0.1.0
#
# Produces at the repo root:
#   Blindfold.zip            what the installer downloads/extracts:
#                              version.dll     (bundled Lovely Injector -> game folder)
#                              Blindfold/**    (src\ payload -> %APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods)
#   BlindfoldInstaller.exe   the installer itself (skip with -NoInstaller)
#
# Then publish both as assets on a GitHub release, e.g.:
#   gh release create v0.1.0 Blindfold.zip BlindfoldInstaller.exe --title v0.1.0 --notes "..."
# The installer reads releases via the GitHub API, so the tag (vX.Y.Z) is the
# version users see and update-checks compare against.
