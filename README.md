# Blindfold

An accessibility mod for **Balatro** that provides screen reader support for
blind players. 

For discussion of Blindfold, as well as my other modding projects, I have a
[Discord](https://discord.gg/Dz8u2Pr9py/).

If you would like to support my modding work, I also have a
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bradjrenshaw/).

## Features

- Screenreader output for all game screens and events
- Full keyboard and controller support, all rebindable
- Play-by-play scoring announcements, with per-announcement toggles
- Status hotkeys for the numbers you need mid-hand (hands, discards, score,
  money, joker slots)
- Review buffers for re-reading detail at your own pace
- Translations for all of Balatro's languages

## Installation

### Windows
1. Download `BlindfoldInstaller.exe` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bradjrenshaw/Blindfold/releases/latest).
2. Run it. It finds your Steam install of Balatro automatically (use
   Browse... if you keep the game somewhere unusual) and shows one row of
   buttons: press **Install**.

   Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognized app the first time:
   choose "More info", then "Run anyway".
3. Launch Balatro through Steam. You should hear **"Blindfold loaded."**

Prefer a console? Run `BlindfoldInstaller.exe --cli` for the same flows as a
menu.

### macOS
1. Download `BlindfoldInstaller.app.zip` (extracting it to get `BlindfoldInstaller.app`) from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bradjrenshaw/Blindfold/releases/latest).
2. Run it. It finds your Steam install of Balatro automatically and shows one row of
   buttons: press **Install**.
3. Tell Steam to launch the game through the Lovely Injector (see
   **Launching on macOS** below) — without this the game starts unmodded.
4. Launch Balatro through Steam. You should hear **"Blindfold loaded."**

Prefer a console? Run `./BlindfoldInstaller.app/Contents/MacOS/blindfold-installer --cli` for the same flows as a menu.

#### Launching on macOS

Lovely injects itself with `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, which Steam does not set
on its own, so a stock Steam launch loads Balatro without any mods. The
installer puts `steam_lovely_macos.sh` in the game folder to handle this:

1. Steam → right-click **Balatro** → **Properties** → **General**.
2. Set **Launch Options** to the full path of that script followed by
   `%command%`, keeping the quotes (the path contains spaces) and writing the
   path out literally rather than using `~` or `$HOME`:

   ```
   "/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Balatro/steam_lovely_macos.sh" %command%
   ```
3. Launch from Steam as usual.

Do **not** put `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=... %command%` in Launch Options
directly. Steam does not parse that string with a shell, so it tries to run a
program by that literal name and fails with *"Failed to start process for
this game : OS Error 260"*.

To launch without Steam (no playtime tracking, no overlay), run
`run_lovely_macos.sh` from the game folder instead.

**Updating:** run the installer again. It tells you when a newer version is
out and the Install/Update button adjusts. "Install dev build" instead
installs the very latest work-in-progress code from this repository.

### Manual installation

Prefer to place files yourself? Each release also ships `Blindfold.zip`
(this README is included in it):

1. **Copy Injector Files**:
   * **Windows**: Copy `version.dll` from the zip into Balatro's game folder, next to `Balatro.exe` (Steam: right-click Balatro → Manage → Browse local files).
   * **macOS**: Copy `liblovely.dylib`, `run_lovely_macos.sh` and `steam_lovely_macos.sh` from the zip into Balatro's game folder, next to `Balatro.app`, and make the two `.sh` files executable (`chmod +x *.sh`).
   This is the [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) mod loader — skip it if you already run other Lovely mods.
2. **Copy Mod Payload**:
   * **Windows**: Copy the zip's `Blindfold` folder (excluding `lib/libprism.dylib` which is Mac-only) into `%APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods`, so it ends up at `%APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods\Blindfold` (create `Mods` if it doesn't exist yet).
   * **macOS**: Copy the zip's `Blindfold` folder (excluding `lib/prism.dll` which is Windows-only) into `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods`, so it ends up at `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods/Blindfold` (create `Mods` if it doesn't exist yet).
3. Launch Balatro through Steam. On macOS, set the Steam launch options
   first — see **Launching on macOS** above; without them the game starts
   unmodded.

To update manually, delete the `Blindfold` folder under `Mods` and copy in the new zip's folder — settings live outside it and survive. To uninstall manually, delete the `Blindfold` folder under `Mods` and the injector files.

**Uninstalling:** the installer's Uninstall button removes the mod and
offers to also remove the Lovely Injector and Blindfold's settings. Your
game saves are never touched.

## Getting started

Start Balatro through Steam and wait for "Blindfold loaded." From there:

- **Arrow keys** (or d-pad / left stick) move between controls; each speaks
  as you land on it. Screens are laid out as rows: up/down switches rows,
  left/right moves within one.
- **Enter** (or A) activates the focused control.
- The **play screen** reads top to bottom: your jokers and consumables, the
  blind, played cards, your hand, then the action buttons. Select cards in
  your hand with Enter (controller A), then press **X to play** or **C to
  discard** (controller X / Y).
- **Space** (controller LT + A) picks up the focused card so you can
  reorder: move to where it should go and press it again to place ("place
  between X and Y" tells you where a drop lands). Works on jokers,
  consumables, and hand cards — hands score left to right.
- **S sells / U uses** the focused joker or consumable (controller LB / RB).
- **Status chords** answer the common questions instantly: hands left
  (Ctrl+X, controller LT+X), discards left (Ctrl+C, LT+Y), score and goal
  (Ctrl+S, LT+B), money (Ctrl+M, RT+X), joker slots (Ctrl+J, RT+Y).
- **Ctrl+arrows** (controller right stick) open the review buffers:
  Left/Right switch buffers (game status, card detail), Up/Down step through
  their lines — for re-reading anything at your own pace.
- Announcement toggles, speech options, and rebinding all live in
  **Options → Blindfold**.

of Balatro's languages (German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
Dutch, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indonesian). These are machine translations, so please let me know if anything is incorrect.
